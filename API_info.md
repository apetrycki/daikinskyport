The first step to interfacing with a Daikin Skyport thermostat is to login:
```
curl --location --request POST "https://api.daikinskyport.com/users/auth/login" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"email": "<email>", "password": "<password>"}'
```

This uses the email and password registered with the DaikinOne+ Home app to connect and returns access and refresh tokens:
```
{"accessToken":"<token>","accessTokenExpiresIn":3600,"refreshToken":"<token>","tokenType":"Bearer"}
```

You can now verify your access token by running:
```
curl --location --request GET "https://api.daikinskyport.com/users/me" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <access token>"
```

Which returns:
```
{"id":"<some UUID-type string>","name":"<first> #<last>","email":"<email>"}
```

To refresh a token:
```
curl --location --request POST "https://api.daikinskyport.com/users/auth/token" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"email": "<email>", "refreshToken": "<refresh token>"}'
```

Once you have an access token, you can connect and retrieve what locations are available to the account:
```
curl --location --request GET "https://api.daikinskyport.com/locations" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <access token>"
```

which returns:
```
[{"id":"<UUID of location>","name":"<Location Name>","address":"<street address>","city":"<city>",
"province":"<state/province>","postalCode":"<zip code>",
"country":"<country>","timeZone":"America/New_York","latitude":<lat>,"longitude":<long>,"hasOwner":true}]
```

And retrieve the devices:
```
curl --location --request GET "https://api.daikinskyport.com/devices" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <access token>"
```

Which returns:
```
[{"id":"<UUID of the device>","locationId":"<UUID of location>","name":"<name of device>",
"model":"ONEPLUS","firmwareVersion":"1.4.5","createdDate":1563568617,"hasOwner":true,"hasWrite":true}]
```

Once you know the device ID, you can use it to probe the device:
```
curl --location --request GET "https://api.daikinskyport.com/deviceData/<UUID of device>" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <access token>"
```

Which returns (truncated):

There are almost 900 elements when I probe my thermostat.  Some abbreviations used when looking at the data:
```
ct = current value?
ht = heating temperature
sp = set point
csp = cooling set point
hsp = heating set point
sched = schedule
hum = humidity/humidifier
AH - Air Handler
IFC = Indoor Furnace
```

How times work:
They decided to be weird with how times work. Basically every 1=15mins. So midnight (00:00) is 0, 00:15=1, 08:00=8x4=32, etc.

How percentages work:
Percentage numbers range from 0-200.  This provides a 0.5% increment.  To get a proper percent, just divide the value by 2.

To set configuration:
```
curl --location --request PUT "https://api.daikinskyport.com/deviceData/<device UUID>" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <access token>"
--data '{"geofencingAway": "False", "schedEnabled": "False","schedOverride":0,"cspHome":24.4}'
```

Set a temperature hold:
```
"geofencingAway": Set whether geofencing is in away mode, true/false
"schedEnabled": Set if thermostat goes off schedule or manual set point, true=schedule, false=set point
"schedOverride": integer, when set to 1 while schedEnabled=true it sets a temporary hold
"cspHome": cooling set point, temperature in C, one decimal place
"hspHome": heating set point, temperature in C, one decimal place
```

Set the operating mode:
```
“mode”: 2 is cool, 3 is auto, 1 is heat, 0 is off, emergency heat is 4
```

Set screen brightness:
```
“displayBrightness”: 0-100, percentage
```

```

TJCoffey has also been working on deciphering the Daikin API info and has some more updated information on thermostat parameters:
